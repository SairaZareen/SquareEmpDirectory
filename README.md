#SquareEmpDirectory

#Build Tool - GRADLE - 7.1.3, Kotlin - 1.6.2

#Steps to run: Running the app displays the employees list , pressing the refresh button 
#on the actionBar updates the employees

#Focus Areas : Architercural design (MVVM), Dependency Injection(Dagger 2),Room database 
#use for caching and displaying 

#Reasons for focus areas : MVVM helps in writing clean, clear, understandable code which 
#can be easily extended when new requirements arise, dependency injection enables easy testing

#Hours spent : Spent atleast 2 hours daily for 5 five days

#TradeOffs : 1)Proper error handling could have been implemented using a sealed Resource class with
#success,loading,error subclasses 
#            2)Hilt Implementation instead of Dagger2
#            3)Better UI implementation for recycler view list item and better actionBar UI

#Weakest Part :Network state handling
#I had previously done projects like this for my portfolio, so just followed those steps

#Other Info : Testing - Implemented Unit Test with JUnit, Roboelectric, Truth libraries
